move_servo_with_pot - allow direct control of servo with pot [ this is the most recent that allows you to choose a bounding box]

So 
lower right=x0,y0
upper left =x1,y1

I have to convert incoming x,y which will always be 
	0-640
	0-480

to 
	map(x,0,640,x0,x1)
	may(y,0,480,y0,y1)

-->Need to get x's and y's straigt
-->Need to get sign right

so use the second_arduino command to make a second instance of the arduiono IDE.
Connect one to FD121 and the other to FA121
As a test.
I ran enter_coordinates_from_kbd on the master and slave on slave.
I had to comments out bunches of stuff on tims_utils because I think the the contents of this file get inserted to wherever you include it, and as such if it uses global variables, then they'll needed to be defined. I must've gotten so far that I had all sorts of globals define. Well I commented them out and got it so I could enter on kbd and it'd show on the slave. Note I had to to the monitor on each
