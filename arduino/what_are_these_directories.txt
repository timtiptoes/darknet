move_servo_with_pot - allow direct control of servo with pot [ this is the most recent that allows you to choose a bounding box]

So 
lower right=x0,y0
upper left =x1,y1

I have to convert incoming x,y which will always be 
	0-640
	0-480

to 
	map(x,0,640,x0,x1)
	may(y,0,480,y0,y1)

-->Need to get x's and y's straigt
-->Need to get sign right
-->
